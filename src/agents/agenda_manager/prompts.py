<instructions>

## Process:
1. Analyze the user's response to identify important information:
   - Split long responses into MULTIPLE coherent parts.
     * Each memory should cover one part of the user's direct response.
     * Together, all memories should cover the ENTIRE user's response.
   - For EACH piece of information worth storing:
     * Create a concise but descriptive title.
     * Summarize the information clearly.
     * Add relevant metadata (e.g., topics, emotions, when, where, who, etc.).
     * Identify ALL relevant subtopics from the provided topics list.
     * For each relevant subtopic, rate its importance (1-10) and explain relevance.

2. Linking and coverage:
   - Each memory can relate to MULTIPLE subtopics.
   - Use `subtopic_links` as a list of objects, where each object contains:
     * `subtopic_id`: ID from <topics_list>
     * `importance`: 1-10 score for how critical this memory is to THIS subtopic
     * `relevance`: Brief explanation of why this memory matters to THIS subtopic
   - Importance scoring guide:
     * 9-10: Core, defining information for this subtopic
     * 7-8: Highly relevant, adds significant depth
     * 5-6: Moderately relevant, provides context
     * 3-4: Tangentially related, minor detail
     * 1-2: Barely relevant, mentioned in passing
   - Do NOT invent subtopic_ids; only use ones explicitly listed in <topics_list>.
   - A single memory should link to multiple subtopics when the information is relevant to multiple areas.

3. Skip all tool calls if the response:
   - Contains no meaningful information,
   - Is just greetings or ice-breakers,
   - Shows user deflection or non-answers.

1. Analyze Response Content:
   - Is this response worth storing? (Skip if just greetings/deflections)
   - How should I split this response into meaningful segments?
     * Look for natural breaks in topics, experiences, or time periods.
     * Each split should be a complete, coherent thought.
   
2. Multi-Subtopic Relevance Analysis:
   For each memory segment:
   - Which subtopics does this information relate to?
   - For EACH relevant subtopic:
     * How important is this memory for understanding THAT subtopic? (1-10)
     * Why does this memory matter to THAT subtopic specifically?
   - Example reasoning:
     "User worked at Google for 5 years on LLM team"
     → career_history (importance: 9) - Core career experience defining professional background
     → technical_expertise (importance: 7) - LLM team indicates AI/ML skills
     → company_culture (importance: 4) - Google experience provides work environment context

3. Coverage Check:
   - Have I captured all key experiences, events, and opinions?
   - For each memory, have I identified ALL relevant subtopics (not just the primary one)?
   - Are importance scores differentiated across subtopics (same memory can have different importance)?
   - Do the subtopic links collectively cover the full semantic space of the response?

# Session Agenda Update
## Process:
1. Focus ONLY on the most recent user message in the conversation history
2. Review existing session agenda, paying attention to:
   - Which questions are marked as "Answered"
   - What information is already captured in existing notes

## Guidelines for Adding Notes:
- Only process information from the latest user message
- Skip questions marked as "Answered" - do not add more notes to them
- Only add information that:
  - Answers previously unanswered questions
  - Provides significant new details for partially answered questions
  - Contains valuable information not related to any existing questions

## Adding Notes:
For each piece of new information worth storing:
1. Use the update_session_agenda tool
2. Include:
   - [ID] tag with question number for relevant questions
   - Leave ID empty for valuable information not tied to specific questions
3. Write concise, fact-focused notes. The notes should capture specific, professional details.
   - **Good Example:** "User has 5 years of experience with Python, primarily using Pandas and Scikit-learn for data analysis in Project X."
   - **Bad Example:** "User seems to like Python."
   - **Good Example:** "Managed a team of 4 engineers and delivered the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule."
   - **Bad Example:** "User is a good manager."

## Tool Usage:
- Make separate update_session_agenda calls for each distinct piece of new information
- Skip if:
  - The question is marked as "Answered"
  - The information is already captured in existing notes
  - No new information is found in the latest message

"""

UPDATE_SUBTOPIC_COVERAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
<instructions>

## Process

1. **Determine Subtopic Nature**
   - Infer whether the subtopic is:
     * **STAR-appropriate** → if it describes an event, project, or experience involving actions, challenges, or outcomes.
     * **Descriptive** → if it focuses on background, motivation, interest, reasoning, or conceptual understanding rather than a specific event.

2. **Evaluate Completeness**
   - A subtopic is NEVER covered on the strength of its first answer alone, no
     matter how fluent that answer sounds. A single generic response (a claim
     with no concrete example, story, tool name, number, or specific moment
     attached) is NOT sufficient — that is exactly the shallow, checklist-style
     interviewing this system exists to avoid.
   - Before marking ANYTHING covered, check: does at least one note for this
     subtopic contain a SPECIFIC, concrete detail (a named tool/person/place,
     a number, a described moment or decision, a direct example)? If every
     note is a generality ("I handle X", "I'm cautious about Y", "I focus on
     Z") with no concrete instance behind it, the subtopic is NOT covered —
     leave it open so the interviewer can probe the concrete noun.
   - For **STAR-appropriate** subtopics:
       * Coverage requires STAR components, each grounded in a specific
         instance, not a general description of the role:
         - **Situation:** A specific context or example, not "in general..."
         - **Task:** The concrete objective in that instance
         - **Action:** The actual steps taken, named specifically
         - **Result:** A real outcome, metric, or specific reflection
       * Fully covered only when most components are present AND at least one
         is grounded in a concrete example rather than a paraphrase of the
         question.
   - For **Descriptive** subtopics:
       * Coverage requires the theme explained with a concrete anchor — a
         named example, a specific instance, a number — not just a fluent
         general statement.
       * A subtopic answered only in generalities stays open even if the
         prose "sounds complete."
   - It is expected and CORRECT for a subtopic to stay open across multiple
     turns while the interviewer drills into one concrete detail. Do not mark
     it covered just to make room for "more important subtopics later" — depth
     on fewer subtopics is more valuable than shallow coverage of many.

3. **Aggregation**
   - For fully covered subtopics, synthesize the notes into a coherent and concise final summary capturing the essence of what was discussed.
   - Avoid repetition or rephrasing—focus on integration and clarity.

4. **Tool Invocation (Fully Covered)**
   - Only call `update_subtopic_coverage` for subtopics that are fully covered.
   - Each call should include:
       * `subtopic_id`: the ID of the covered subtopic.
       * `aggregated_notes`: the aggregated summary notes.

## Process
1. Read the topics and subtopics in `topics_list`.
2. Read the user's *most recent message* or *additional_context* carefully. Use the last meeting summary and previous events only as supporting background.
3. Decide whether you can think of some NEW emergent subtopics to be added to the interview agenda that have not yet covered by current topics and subtopics listed.
4. Add exactly one emergent subtopic—the strongest candidate—or none.

## Decision rules (apply strictly)
- The idea must fall *within one of the existing topics* and *not related to any existing subtopics*. If it does not clearly map to a parent topic, do NOT add it.
- The idea must be *novel*: the idea of emergence topic is uncommon, so if it can reasonably be addressed within any existing subtopic (even loosely), do NOT add it.
- If multiple candidate ideas appear, select **only the strongest single candidate**.
- If no candidate satisfies all rules, do not add any new subtopic.

## Ranking heuristic for choosing the strongest candidate
Score each candidate based on:
  Score = Novelty x Expected Information Gain x Direct Relevance
Where:
- Novelty = how meaningfully different it is from all existing subtopics.
- Expected Information Gain = how likely a follow-up question on this idea would yield new, useful insights.
- Direct Relevance = how clearly the idea aligns with its parent topic.

## Practical checks
- The emergent subtopic description should be short, clear, and represent an idea (5-10 words, maximum 1 sentence).
- Avoid redundancy, rephrasings, or overly narrow micro-subtopics.
- Do not add subtopics that drift outside the interview's intended scope.

## Examples
- If existing subtopics include "evaluation metrics" and "benchmark selection," and the user mentions "error patterns across languages," treat it as emergent *only if* it cannot reasonably fit under "evaluation."
- If the user suggests "testing on dataset X" but a "datasets" subtopic already exists, do NOT add a new subtopic.

1. Identify candidate emergent idea(s) mentioned in the most recent message to be added as NOVEL subtopic to the current topics and subtopics list (explicitly list them or state "none"). If most recent message is empty, consider additional context or last meeting's summary.
2. Come up with this emergent idea(s) in 5-10 words, maximum 1 sentence.
3. For the selected candidate, review ALL listed topic along with their associated subtopics, and identify the topic ID under which this novel emergent subtopic best fits.
4. Explain, in one short sentence, why this candidate is NOVEL and cannot be reasonably grouped under any existing subtopic, especially since 'emergence' is uncommon.
5. Explain, in one short sentence, why this candidate is the strongest among candidates (use the ranking heuristic: Novelty x Expected Information Gain x Direct Relevance).
6. Conclude with a one-line decision: either "add" or "no_add" and a one-line justification.
7. If you decide to add, then perform the following tool call below of `add_emergent_subtopic`.

<!-- If and only if the decision is "add", produce exactly one tool call below. Otherwise, produce NO tool_calls section. -->
<tool_calls>
  <add_emergent_subtopic>
      <topic_id>The topic ID the emergent subtopic should belong to.</topic_id>
      <subtopic_description>Brief emergent subtopic description.</subtopic_description>
  </add_emergent_subtopic>
</tool_calls>
